Presentation
-----------------------------

The goal of this homework is for you to read a paper, understand it,
and present the paper.

There's a lot of research going on in this fast-moving field.  It's
worthwhile to do a roundup of recent research so that we're all aware
of the recent trends of prominent papers.

What You Have to Do
===================

Your primary deliverable will be a presentation that you'll record for
the class.  We will also have an in-class discussion throughout the
second half of the semester.

How long do you have
====================
Your presentation should be at least ten minutes.  You don't need to review
machine reading, standard datasets, or the motivation for QA.  So
don't use your precious time on stuff that "we already know".  There
is no maximum length, but if you go longer than 10 minutes, I would
encourage you to break it up into smaller pieces.

How to Present the Paper
=================

I encourage you to be creative.  Think about the best way to present
the paper.  Here are some ideas:

  * Create a (skit)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KO2TO_cm2I] that
  explains the key ideas
  * Walk through the code, give examples
  * Have several different presentations from (role-playing
  perspectives)[https://colinraffel.com/blog/role-playing-seminar.html]

It's really up to you!

Questions
===========

 *Q*: Do I have to show my face?
 *A*: No.

 *Q*: Can I use text to speech?
 *A*: In almost all cases, it's better to use your own voice.

 *Q*: Does it have to be a computer science paper?
 *A*: No.

 *Q*: Does it have to be a conference paper?
 *A*: No, books are okay, as are workshop papers.  If it's a preprint,
please clear it with me first (unless it's from one of the authors I
list below).

*Q*: Does it have to be *just* a QA paper?
 *A*: It should have a clear connection to question answering.  If in
 *doubt, ask on Piazza.

Groups
======

Unlike other homeworks, this must be done in groups of 2-4.  There are
no constraints on whom you can be in a group with (but I'd encourage
you to try to form groups with new people, just like you've been doing
for the homeworks.)

Where to Look for Papers
=======================

Part of this exercise is for me to discover papers that I wouldn't
have found normally, so I don't want to give you a list of papers that
you should present. Here are some ideas of people whose work is worth
looking at (but many do more than just QA):

  * [Eric Wallace](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SgST3LkAAAAJ)
  * [Johnathan Berant](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~joberant/publications.html)
  * [Hannaneh Hajishirzi](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~hannaneh/research.html)
  * [Anna Rogers](https://annargrs.github.io/)
  * [Pontus Stenetorp](https://pontus.stenetorp.se/publications.html)
  * [Tongshuang Wu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sherryw/group.html#publications)
  * [Isabelle Augenstein](https://isabelleaugenstein.github.io/publications.html)
  * [Eunsol Choi](https://eunsol.github.io/#publications)
  * [Danqi Chen](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danqic/papers.html)
  * [Chris Manning](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~manning/papers/)
  * [Ikuya Yamada](https://www.ikuya.net/index_en.html)
  * [Sameer Singh](https://sameersingh.org/)
  * [Devi Parikh](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/)
  * [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io/publications/)
  * [Mohit Bansal](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/)
  * [Rishiraj Saha Roy](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/question-answering/)

Note: To prevent over-sampling top institutions, I limited myself to
picking one person at a particular university.

Please think about your paper far enough in advance so that you can
ask if it's a good paper to talk about.  Record your signup
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gJckfe7zK0a3-HJ0xJKGuYegPErUkU5t5o2WcQoAu0g/edit?usp=sharing).
But note that we're not allowing duplicate papers.

What to Cover
================

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but please try to cover:

* What makes the paper interesting.  Why is it worth knowing about?
* Talk about the specifics of its contribution.  What did it do
that other papers didn't.
* Talk about any limitations or problems the paper has.  Be
honest but kind.  This might motivate a new extension / project based
on the ideas of the paper.  

Optional components:

* Feel free to talk about the presentation of the paper; we'll be
talking more about how to write a good paper, so if there are lessons
to learn from this paper about presentation, share them!

How to Divide Work
==================
It's fine to divide work however you want.  One person can make
slides, one person can talk, one person can make figures.  Or all
three people can talk: playing each of the roles if you do the RPG model.  It's up to you, as long as the group agrees.

Grading
=======

This assignment is worth 30 points for the presentations and 20 points
for the QA session you lead during class.
